# Networking_Group


We will implement an end-to-end IoT solution that will satisfy  client needs. We will use the MQTT protocol for 
this implementation. There will be publisher clients that sends data to a broker as well as subscriber clients that receives data from the broker. 
The broker sends data to the appropriate subscriber. 
You will design and build both types of clients according to specifications. The diagram shows an overly simplified architecture of the intended system.
